Check that all you inputs, outputs, and wires have a good connection. Even some that were working originally may have come loose as you crafted your device. 

Check that the pins in your code match the pins your LED is connected to. If you removed your pins to craft your device you need to check they have been reconnected as they were originally. 

If you have checked everything and you are still not seeing or hearing the result you expect then try using a new electronic component if you have some spare. This will ensure that your current electronic component is not broken.

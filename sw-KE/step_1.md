There are various reasons why input and output components may not work at all or as you expect them to. Here are some common things to check:

+ Check that all you inputs, outputs, and wires have a good connection. Even some that were working originally may have come loose if you have moved or crafted your device.
+ Check that the pins in your code match the pins your component is connected to. If you removed your pins to move or craft your device you need to check they have been reconnected as they were originally.
+ If your component has polarity, positive (+) and negative (-) sides, make sure they are connected the right way round.
+ If you are using a Buzzer check that you have removed the sticker that covers the sound hole

If you have checked everything and you are still not seeing or hearing the result you expect then try using a new electronic component if you have some spare. This will ensure that your current electronic component is not broken.
